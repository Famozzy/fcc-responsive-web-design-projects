              Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in
              rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or
              shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the
              fundamentals.

              For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools
              available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and
              positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting
              and frustrating.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following simple layout designs are either difficult or
              impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient,
              flexible way:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount
                of the available width/height, regardless of how much
                width/height is available.
              </li>
              <li>
                Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same
                height even if they contain a different amount of content.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of
              layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!

              In this article, you'll work through a series of exercises to help
              you understand how flexbox works. To get started, you should make
              a local copy of the first starter file —
              <a
                href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html"

                flexbox0.html</a
              >
              from our github repo. Load it in a modern browser (like Firefox or
              Chrome) and have a look at the code in your code editor. You can
              also
              <a
                href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html"

            <p>
              You'll see that we have a

                ><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a
              >
              element with a top level heading inside it and a
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
                ><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a
              >
              element containing three
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
                ><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a
              >
              s. We're going to use these to create a fairly standard three
              column layout.

            </a>
          </header>
          <article>
            <p>
              To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out
              as flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display"
                ><code>display</code></a
              >
              on the parent element of the elements you want to affect. In this
              case we want to lay out the
              <a href=""><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a> elements, so we set
              this on the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
                ><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a
              >:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>section {
  display : flex;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              This causes the &lt;section&gt; element to become a
              <strong>flex container</strong> and its children to become
              <strong>flex items</strong>. The result of this should be
              something like so:
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example2.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              So, this single declaration gives us everything we need.
              Incredible, right? We have our multiple column layout with
              equal-sized columns, and the columns are all the same height. This
              is because the default values given to flex items (the children of
              the flex container) are set up to solve common problems such as
              this.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be clear, let's reiterate what is happening here. The element
              we've given a
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display"
                >display</a
              >
              value of <code>flex</code> to is acting like a block-level element
              in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but its
              children are laid out as flex items. The next section will explain
              in more detail what this means. Note also that you can use a
              display value of <code>inline-flex</code> if you wish to lay out
              an element's children as flex items, but have that element behave
              like an inline element.

              When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along
              two axes:
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flex_terms.png"

            />
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <strong>main axis</strong> is the axis running in the
                direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as rows
                across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end of
                this axis are called the <strong>main start</strong> and
                <strong>main end</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>cross axis</strong> is the axis running
                perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in.
                The start and end of this axis are called the
                <strong>cross start </strong> and <strong>cross end</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The parent element that has <code>display: flex</code> set on it
                (the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> in our example) is called the
                <strong>flex container</strong> .
              </li>
              <li>
                The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container
                are called
                <strong>flex items</strong>
                (the
                <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
                elements in our example).
              </li>
            </ul>

              Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent
              sections. You can always refer back to it if you get confused
              about any of the terms being used.

              Flexbox provides a property called
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction"
                ><code>flex-direction</code></a
              >
              that specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction
              the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to
              <code>row</code>, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the
              direction your browser's default language works in (left to right,
              in the case of an English browser).
            </p>
            <p>
              Try adding the following declaration to your
              <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>flex-direction : column;</code></pre>
            <p>
              You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much
              like they were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, delete
              this declaration from your example.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Note</strong> : You can also lay out flex items in a
                reverse direction using the <code>row-reverse</code> and
                <code>column-reverse</code> values. Experiment with these values
                too!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping">

            <p>
              One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in
              your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow
              their container, breaking the layout. Have a look at our
              <a
                href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html"
                >flexbox-wrap0.html</a
              >
              example and try
              <a
                href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html"
                >viewing it live</a
              >
              (take a local copy of this file now if you want to follow along
              with this example):
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example3.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their
              container. One way in which you can fix this is to add the
              following declaration to your <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>flex-wrap : wrap;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Also, add the following declaration to your
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> rule:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>flex : 200px;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Try this now. You'll see that the layout looks much better with
              this included:
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example4.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children
              fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the
              next line. The <code>flex: 200px</code> declaration set on the
              articles means that each will be at least 200px wide. We'll
              discuss this property in more detail later on. You might also
              notice that the last few children on the last row are each made
              wider so that the entire row is still filled.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction"
                ><code>flex-direction</code></a
              >
              property value to <code>row-reverse</code>. Now you'll see that
              you still have your multiple row layout, but it starts from the
              opposite corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.

        <section class="main-section" id="Flex-flow_shorthand">

            <p>
              At this point it's worth noting that a shorthand exists for
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction"
                ><code>flex-direction</code></a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap"
                ><code>flex-wrap</code></a

                ><code>flex-flow</code></a
              >. So, for example, you can replace
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;</code></pre>
            <p>with</p>

            <p>
              Let's now return to our first example and look at how we can
              control what proportion of space flex items take up compared to
              the other flex items. Fire up your local copy of
              <a
                href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html"
                >flexbox0.html</a
              >, or take a copy of
              <a
                href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html"
                >flexbox1.html</a
              >
              as a new starting point (<a
                href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html"
                >see it live</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>article {
  flex : 1;  
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much
              available space along the main axis each flex item will take up
              compared to other flex items. In this case, we're giving each
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element the same value (a value of
              1), which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the spare
              space left after properties like padding and margin have been set.
              This value is proportionally shared among the flex items: giving
              each flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same
              effect.
            </p>
            <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>article:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 2;  
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> takes up twice as much of the
              available width as the other two. There are now four proportion
              units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex
              items have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available
              space. The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the
              available space (or one-half).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also specify a minimum size value within the flex value.
              Try updating your existing article rules like so:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>article {
  flex: 1 200px;  
}

article:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 2 200px;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              This basically states, "Each flex item will first be given 200px
              of the available space. After that, the rest of the available
              space will be shared according to the proportion units." Try
              refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example1.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The real value of flexbox can be seen in its
              flexibility/responsiveness. If you resize the browser window or
              add another <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element, the layout
              continues to work just fine.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Horizontal_and_vertical_alignment">

          </header>
          <article>
            <p>
              You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the
              main or cross axis. We're going to turn this into a neat, flexible
              button/toolbar. At the moment you'll see a horizontal menu bar
              with some buttons jammed into the top left-hand corner.
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example5.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>First, take a local copy of this example.</p>
            <p>Now, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-around;  
}</code></pre>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_center_space-around.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Refresh the page and you'll see that the buttons are now nicely
              centered horizontally and vertically. We've done this via two new
              properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
              >
                <code>align-items</code>
              </a>
              controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                By default, the value is <code>stretch</code>, which stretches
                all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross
                axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed width in the cross axis
                direction, then all flex items will become as long as the
                longest flex item. This is how our first example had columns of
                equal height by default.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code>center</code> value that we used in our above code
                causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be
                centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's
                buttons are centered vertically.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can also have values like <code>flex-start</code> and
                <code>flex-end</code>, which will align all items at the start
                and end of the cross axis respectively. See
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
                  ><code>align-items</code></a
                >
                for the full details.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can override the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
                ><code> align-items</code></a
              >
              behavior for individual flex items by applying the align-self
              property to them. For example, try adding the following to your
              CSS:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>button:first-child{
  align-self: flex-end;  
}</code></pre>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_first-child_flex-end.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Have a look at what effect this has and remove it again when
              you've finished.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content"
                ><code>justify-content</code></a
              >
              controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The default value is <code>flex-start</code>, which makes all
                the items sit at the start of the main axis.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can use <code>flex-end</code> to make them sit at the end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>center</code> is also a value for
                <code>justify-content</code>. It'll make the flex items sit in
                the center of the main axis.
              </li>
              <li>
                he value we've used above, <code>space-around</code>, is useful
                — it distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a
                bit of space left at either end.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is another value, <code>space-between</code>, which is
                very similar to <code>space-around</code> except that it doesn't
                leave any space at either end.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We'd like to encourage you to play with these values to see how
              they work before you continue.

              Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex
              items without affecting the source order. This is another thing
              that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              The code for this is simple. Try adding the following CSS to your
              button bar example code:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>button:first-child {
  order: 1;  
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              Refresh and you'll see that the "Smile" button has moved to the
              end of the main axis. Let's talk about how this works in a bit
              more detail:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                By default, all flex items have an
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order"
                >
                  <code> order </code>
                </a>
                value of 0.
              </li>
              <li>
                Flex items with higher specified order values will appear later
                in the display order than items with lower order values.
              </li>
              <li>
                Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source
                order. So if you have four items whose order values have been
                set as 2, 1, 1, and 0 respectively, their display order would be
                4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order
                value and is after it in the source order.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier
              than items whose value is 0. For example, you could make the
              "Blush" button appear at the start of the main axis using the
              following rule:
            </p>
            <pre class="css">
<code>button:last-child {
  order: -1;  
}</code></pre>

              Flexbox support is available in most new browsers: Firefox,
              Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and IE 11, newer versions of
              Android/iOS, etc. However, you should be aware that there are
              still older browsers in use that don't support Flexbox (or do, but
              support a really old, out-of-date version of it.)
            </p>
            <p>
              While you're just learning and experimenting, this doesn't matter
              too much; however, if you're considering using flexbox in a real
              website, you need to do testing and make sure that your user
              experience is still acceptable in as many browsers as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features. For example, if
              a browser is missing a CSS drop shadow, then the site will likely
              still be usable. Not supporting flexbox features, however, will
              probably break a layout completely, making it unusable.
